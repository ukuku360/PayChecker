      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="meta">Effective date: February 19, 2026</p>

      <p>
        These Terms govern your use of PayChecker. By using the service, you agree to these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Service scope</h2>
      <p>
        PayChecker offers roster and pay-estimation tools for planning and record-keeping. It is not payroll software,
        legal advice, or tax advice.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Account responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for keeping account credentials secure</li>
        <li>You are responsible for the data and files uploaded through your account</li>
        <li>You must not use the service for unlawful or abusive activity</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Data accuracy and verification</h2>
      <p>
        You are responsible for reviewing and verifying any estimated values or extracted shifts before relying on them.
        Final compensation and tax outcomes must be confirmed with official records and authorities.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Availability and modifications</h2>
      <p>
        We may modify, suspend, or discontinue features at any time. We may also enforce rate limits or operational
        controls to protect service stability and security.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Third-party services</h2>
      <p>
        PayChecker may rely on third-party services including hosting, authentication, AI processing, ads, and payment
        systems. Their terms and policies also apply where relevant.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, PayChecker is provided on an "as is" basis without warranties, and we
        are not liable for indirect or consequential damages arising from use of the service.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate access when these Terms are violated or when necessary for legal, security, or
        operational reasons.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Contact</h2>
