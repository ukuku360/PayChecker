      <h1>About PayChecker</h1>
      <p class="meta">Last updated: February 19, 2026</p>

      <p>
        PayChecker is a web app for shift workers who need a clear way to track rosters, estimate expected pay, and
        keep organized records over time. The product focuses on practical day-to-day planning for workers with
        variable schedules, multiple jobs, and changing hourly rates.
      </p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>What PayChecker is designed for</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Managing irregular work schedules from one or more employers</li>
          <li>Estimating gross pay based on day type and configured pay rates</li>
          <li>Tracking weekly, monthly, and fiscal-year income trends</li>
          <li>Keeping notes and exports for tax-season preparation</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>How to use the estimates responsibly</h2>
      <p>
        PayChecker provides planning estimates, not official payroll or tax advice. Final pay and tax obligations may
        differ due to award interpretation, payroll adjustments, break policies, overtime rules, allowances, and
        individual circumstances. You should verify official outcomes using your employer records and government
        guidance.
      </p>

      <h2>Data and workflow approach</h2>
      <p>
        The app combines manual scheduling tools with optional roster extraction. Extracted shifts should always be
        reviewed before saving. Users can correct mapped job types, times, and hours to avoid carrying OCR mistakes
        into reports.
      </p>

      <h2>Who commonly benefits</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Hospitality and retail workers with weekend and holiday penalties</li>
        <li>Working holiday and student visa holders managing changing rosters</li>
        <li>Workers comparing expected pay against payslips each cycle</li>
      </ul>
